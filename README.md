## Inspiration
The birth of this app comes from the need to keep pets safe and secure, no matter where they are. Using the Trackonomy platform, it provides real-time tracking and temperature monitoring, ensuring pets stay within safe zones and comfortable conditions. 

## What it does
This app helps pet handlers track pets' location and monitor their temperature using the Trackonomy platform. It alerts if the pet enters a restricted area or if the temperature becomes unsafe. By providing real-time updates and alerts, the app ensures pets stay safe and comfortable at all times.

## How we built it
The app is built using the Trackonomy platform for real-time pet tracking and monitoring. It uses GPS technology to track the pet's location and determine if it enters restricted areas. The app also monitors temperature conditions to ensure the pet stays in a safe environment.

For the backend, it uses Python for processing location and temperature data, including the Haversine formula to calculate distances. The system triggers alerts when necessary, notifying pet handlers through a user-friendly interface. 

## Challenges we ran into
We had challenges to learn and build the app and write code in such a short time frame. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to create the app using the Trackonomy platform

## What we learned
We learnt about the Trackonomy platform and different tracking features that the platform offers

## What's next for TrackoPet
We would like to enhance the app and put more features in the app such as health monitoring that integrates more sensors to track the petâ€™s health, such as heart rate, activity levels, or hydration, alongside location and temperature.
